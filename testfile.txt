Create new file in sachi059-branch

Now testing this file by adding to this to staging area at master branch.


Now the file is at staging area, but i am still changing content of the file to check
what happens with the file.

Now i am learning about diff command, currently this file was in staged area, and i am 
adding changes to this, this should act as change in current directory.
In this case this file should be both staged and commited.

Added this line while doing changes in a branch which i am going to merge with master branch.
